# Crystal Cove

_A vim colorscheme for teenage sleuths road-tripping in their gap year._

The color palette consists entirely of hues taken from the following promotional poster image:

## Install
The colors/crystalcove.vim file can of course be copied to ~/.vim/colors, etc.
**OR**, for those of us enjoying [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): 
    
    Plug 'jayhowie/crystal-cove'

Next, set the color scheme and be sure to enable termguicolors:

    colorscheme crystalcove
    set termguicolors

A 256-color palette is included, derived from a color distance function implemented in [this helpful script](https://github.com/MarkLodato/scripts/blob/master/256colors_convert). Still, 24-bit True Color is preferred for the colorscheme. The 256-color palette is just not quite the same...


- Absolutely derivative of [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice), uses identical highlight groups.
- Built using [Vim-RNB](https://github.com/romainl/vim-rnb).
- Much respect and thanks to [romainl](https://github.com/romainl). _Merci pour cet excellent travail._
